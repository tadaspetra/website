Hey, I'm Tadas. If you don't know me, I am a Flutter Developer, YouTuber, and now Developer Evangelist at Agora. This is my blog site, and here is why it exists.

## The Reason
All these platforms on the internet are driven by algorithms. And no matter how much you want to not care about them, you still do, and need/want to keep up with them to stay relevant. And even though I have a lot of hobbies other than development I rarely share them. 

Each one of these other hobbies does have one similarity. **Learning**. Learning is what my life is centered around, and it is the main message that I want to share. The reason you have only seen development topics from me is simply that it is the most accessible, easiest to learn something daily, and the *algorithms* prefer you to niche down.

But, this is my website, my blog, and no algorithm is going to tell me what to write about ðŸ˜Š

## The Plan
One of my favorite hobbies is reading. That is the first idea that comes to mind is having "book notes" and "book reviews" for the books that I enjoy reading. 

Inevitably there will be some articles about development, since that is what the majority of my work is on, and probably some articles correlating to the videos I make.

But the plan is to separate each type of article by tags. Tags can quickly get out of hand, so the plan is also to keep them to a minimum, so the site doesn't get cluttered. And if you only care about one of these tags, you can tune into just those, but in my biased opinion, there will be a lot of cool things to learn from it all.

Here's a list of some of the tags I think *could* be used:

* **personal** - articles like this, that deal with more personal things not related to anything specifically. Life updates, site updates, anything about me.
* **book-notes** - I like to take notes for each book that I read so that if I ever need to go back and find a specific point or refresh about it, it's easily available. Like a summary, but only for the important parts
* **book-review** - My thoughts about the book. 
* **flutter** - Technical topic about Flutter
* **agora** - Technical topic about Agora
* **finance** - This is a topic, I don't talk about much, but something I have been deeply interested in for the past 2-3 years
* **fitness** - I don't know if an article about this will ever make it, but I have been consistently working out for ~5 years, and inconsistently before that. 
* **woodworking** - I love building things ðŸ˜Š
* **cars** - This goes with the previous one, I have been into cars for a long time. On average I change cars once a year, and I have made money on most of them.

And although all these topics are different from each other, they do focus on one thing. **Learning**. 

This blog gives me the freedom to branch out.
